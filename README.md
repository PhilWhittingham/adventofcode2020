# adventofcode2020
AOC 2020 problems solved in Go. https://adventofcode.com/

## Rationale
With a desire to increase my proficiency in problem solving, Golang and overall programming, I've opted to take part in this years Advent Of Code challenges. The answers are in this repository and range in completeness (and *polish*). Everything that has been pushed so far earned me a star, but I'm aware of some efficiency issues and similar *hacky-ness*.

In the spirit of this being a fun learning activity, I welcome any feedback on efficiency, Golang usage or anything else.
